## Why this codebase exists

Field content and fermion spectrum of the Standard Model: 45 fermions in three generations, the 1-of-4680 admissible template, mass-ratio structure, Cabibbo angle, CKM matrix structure. Currently PDF-only; .tex source pending.

This repository is the executable proof.

The codebase is a faithful subset of the canonical APF codebase v6.9 (frozen 2026-04-18; 355 verify_all checks, 342 bank-registered theorems across 19 modules + `apf/standalone/`). Each theorem in the manuscript traces to a named `check_*` function in `apf/core.py`, which can be called independently and returns a structured result.

The codebase requires Python 3.8+ and NumPy / SciPy (some numerical lemmas use them; see `pyproject.toml`).

## How to verify

Three paths, in order of increasing friction:

**1. Colab notebook — zero install.** [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ethan-Brooke/APF-Paper-4-Admissibility-Constraints-Field-Content/blob/main/APF_Reviewer_Walkthrough.ipynb) Every key theorem is derived inline, with annotated cells you can inspect and modify. Run all cells — the full verification takes under a minute.

**2. Browser — zero install.** Open the [Interactive Derivation DAG](https://ethan-brooke.github.io/APF-Paper-4-Admissibility-Constraints-Field-Content/). Explore the dependency graph. Hover any node for its mathematical statement, key result, and shortest derivation chain to A1. Click **Run Checks** to watch all theorems verify in topological order.

**3. Local execution.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Brooke/APF-Paper-4-Admissibility-Constraints-Field-Content.git
cd APF-Paper-4-Admissibility-Constraints-Field-Content
pip install -e .
python run_checks.py
```

Expected output:

```
      Paper 4 (Admissibility Constraints and Structural Saturation): 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 total — verified in <minutes>
```

**4. Individual inspection.**

```python
from apf.bank import get_check
r = get_check('T_Born')()
print(r['key_result'])
```

For reviewers, a [dedicated guide](REVIEWERS_GUIDE.md) walks through the logical architecture, the structural assumptions, and the anticipated objections.

## Theorem mapping table

This table maps every result in the manuscript to its executable verification.

| Check | Type | Summary |
|-------|------|---------|

All check functions reside in `apf/core.py`. Every function listed above can be called independently and returns a structured result including its logical dependencies and the mathematical content it verifies.

The canonical computational engine — the full bank of 342 theorems across 19 modules — is the **APF Codebase** ([Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18604548)). Every per-paper repo is a faithful subset of that engine.
